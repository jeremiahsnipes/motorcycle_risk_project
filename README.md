# ANA 699 Capstone Project  
Motorcycle Crash Risk Analysis

## Overview  
This repository contains materials for the ANA 699 analytic capstone project. The project examines motorcycle crash data in California to identify risk factors, injury severity patterns, and recurring high-risk locations using historical crash and roadway data.

## Project Questions  
- What factors are associated with motorcycle crash occurrence?  
- Under what conditions are injuries more severe?  
- Are certain roadway segments consistently higher risk?  

## Data  
Publicly available California transportation datasets are used, including:  
- California Highway Patrol SWITRS crash data  
- Caltrans roadway and traffic datasets  
- County-level GIS road network data  

## Methods  
- Data cleaning and feature engineering  
- Exploratory data analysis  
- Logistic regression and tree-based models  
- Spatial analysis for high-risk corridor identification  

## Repository Structure
