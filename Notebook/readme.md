# Notebooks

This folder contains Jupyter notebooks used for the ANA 699 capstone project.

## How to Run the Notebook

To use the notebook, you only need **Jupyter Notebook** and the data file.

### What you need
- Jupyter Notebook (Anaconda or similar is fine)
- The file: **SoCal_Motorcycle_Crashes.csv**

### What to do
1. Save **SoCal_Motorcycle_Crashes.csv** anywhere on your computer  
   (Desktop, Documents, or any folder you prefer)

2. Open the notebook:
   Jupyter_Notebook_ANA699A_Final_Project.ipynb

3. Find the code cell that loads the data and update **one line**:
   ```python
   file_path = r"C:\path\to\your\SoCal_Motorcycle_Crashes.csv"
