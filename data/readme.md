# Data Folder

## Data Source
All data files were obtained from the Transportation Injury Mapping System (TIMS), developed by the UC Berkeley Safe Transportation Research and Education Center (SafeTREC). The data are derived from California’s Statewide Integrated Traffic Records System (SWITRS), which contains official, police-reported traffic collision records from the California Highway Patrol and local law enforcement agencies.
